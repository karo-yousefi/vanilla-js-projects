# 3️⃣0️⃣ days, 3️⃣0️⃣ web applications (Vanilla JS)

<br>

✅ A **30-day challenge** to code every day and make something "interesting" 🌟

✅ I tried to make **unique** projects rather than what you've all seen online (To-Do lists, Calculaters, etc) 💠

✅ All the projects are **documented** 📃, Feel free to fork the code and make changes or do the **challenge yourself** 💪, Either these projects or your own ideas 

✅ I try to build at least two projects for each important topic in JS (APIs, DOM Manipulation, Async, etc)
